<div>
	User, who owns item (ex, maintainer of the job/node).	
	There're following requirements to primary owner:
	<ul>
		<li>Owner is registered user</li>
		<li>Owner should have Configuration permissions for the job/slave</li>
	</ul>
	
	During initial setup of the job/slave, plugin considers current user as an primary owner.
